## Test Plan for the TOC  

#### Objective  

This Test Plan was created to validate the functionality, usability, accessibility, and robustness of the Table of Contents (TOC) component on the specified page, ensuring that it meets requirements for release post-refactoring.  

### Scope  

**In-Scope:** The TOC (left-side navigation panel) on the [Aqua Documentation page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/aqua/getting-started-aqua.html).  
**Out-of-Scope:** The "Virtual TOC" (right-side navigation panel) and unrelated page components.  

### Approach  

To verify the componentâ€™s functionality, edge cases, accessibility, and performance QA Team uses the checklist that is a part of the actual Test Plan.  
QA engineers could perform exploratory testing to identify hidden usability or functionality issues.  
Clear and actionable bug report should be created if there were any defects found during the testing.  

### Priorities  

Critical functionality like navigation, highlighting, and collapsing works without issues.  
Edge cases, error handling, and compatibility have expected results across devices and browsers.  
The TOC meets accessibility standards.  

### Acceptance Criteria  

*The TOC is ready for release if:*  
All checklist items pass.  
No critical issues were found.  
The component meets performance, usability, and accessibility standards.
